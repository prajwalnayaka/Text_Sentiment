    <p class="lead">
        This is an advanced Emotion Classification System built using a
        <strong>DistilBERT Transformer model</strong> fine-tuned on over 100,000 sentences.

    <h3>🛠️ How it was built</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Model:</strong> DistilBERT (66 Million Parameters).</li>
        <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> A custom fusion of 3 datasets (106k samples).</li>
        <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Full Fine-Tuning + Iterative Data Cleaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Achieved ~89% accuracy after correcting labeling errors in the 'Sadness' and 'Happiness' classes.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-info mt-4">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong> During development, we discovered that the model was smarter than the original dataset!
        By using the model to audit the data, we fixed over 140 labeling errors, significantly boosting precision.
